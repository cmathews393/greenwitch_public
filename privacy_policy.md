In this document, we may use multiple substitute names for the company and app. Those are as follows:

Any references to an "app", "the app", or "the website" should be understood to mean a legitimately downloaded copy of the Android app, obtained from the Google Play Store, or the web app, accessible at https://greenwitch.app. Any references to "us" or "we" should be understood to mean Catastrophe Software as a whole, which includes Chloe Mathews, sole developer and founder. Any references to "partners" should be understood to mean tools and services that we, Catastrophe Software, use to provide service and access to the app. 

## 2. Where

This Privacy Policy applies on the app, web app, and any associated websites that we may establish related to the Greenwitch app.


## 3. What

This section will outline the data we collect from you and how it is used.

We DO collect, upon signing up for our service, your NAME (as provided to us, optionally) and your EMAIL address (required for use of the service).
We DO collect any OTHER DATA you choose to provide to use, via support requests, feedback, or surveys. In all cases, this submission is voluntary, but in the case of feedback and support requests, we will typically be unable to assist you if we request data or information that you are unwilling to provide. 
We DO collect PHOTOS of plants that you submit via the app or website, which will be stored securely and tied to your account. This data is secured in a way that users cannot access each others data, but we may be able to view and access the content you upload without restriction. 
We DO collect and store DATA ABOUT YOUR PLANTS that you provide to us, and we may process and manipulate said data in aggregate in order to provide you personalised statistics and analytics. This data may be used, in an anonymised fashion, to display global statistics about all users as a whole, but will never be shared un-anonymized, outside of the provisions in the next statement.
We DO collect and store data about your account, usage patterns, device information, and other "METADATA" about your usage of the app and website. This data is used for performance improvements, bug fixes, and feature rollouts. This data MAY be correlated in some cases with specific data submitted by you, for example, a request to create a plant that causes an error may include data about that plant in the error log. This data does not explicitly include your personal information as described in the first statement, but again, it MAY be correlated with that specific data, or other identifying information such as your account ID. 
We DO NOT collect precise geolocation data, sourced from your phone or computers GPS data, but we MAY correlate usage patterns with nonspecific geolocation data, sourced from your IP address or other metadata.
